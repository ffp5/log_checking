# log_checking

# Introduction
This Python script provides a basic logging tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. The tool allows you to parse, process, and display logs from a specified file. Logs can be filtered based on priority and sorted by either priority or date.

# Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script using the following command:

python script_name.py path/to/logfile.log

Replace script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script and path/to/logfile.log with the path to your log file.

The GUI window will appear with options to display logs based on priority, sort logs by priority or date, and display additional information for each log entry.

Select the desired options and interact with the GUI.
